## System Requirements üì¶

- Recommended minimum 4 CPU cores or more, 8G of memory or more, GPU is not required
- Windows 10 or MacOS 11.0, and their later versions

## Installation & Deployment üì•

- Try to avoid using **Chinese paths** to prevent unpredictable issues
- Ensure your **network** is stable, meaning you can access foreign websites normally

#### ‚ë† Clone the Project

```shell
git clone https://github.com/harry0703/MoneyPrinterTurbo.git
```

#### ‚ë° Modify the Configuration File

- Copy the `config.example.toml` file and rename it to `config.toml`
- Follow the instructions in the `config.toml` file to configure `pexels_api_keys` and `llm_provider`, and according to
  the llm_provider's service provider, set up the corresponding API Key

#### ‚ë¢ Configure Large Language Models (LLM)

- To use `GPT-4.0` or `GPT-3.5`, you need an `API Key` from `OpenAI`. If you don't have one, you can set `llm_provider`
  to `g4f` (a free-to-use GPT library https://github.com/xtekky/gpt4free)

### Docker Deployment üê≥

#### ‚ë† Launch the Docker Container

If you haven't installed Docker, please install it first https://www.docker.com/products/docker-desktop/
If you are using a Windows system, please refer to Microsoft's documentation:

1. https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/wsl/install
2. https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/wsl/tutorials/wsl-containers

```shell
cd MoneyPrinterTurbo
docker-compose up
```

#### ‚ë° Access the Web Interface

Open your browser and visit http://0.0.0.0:8501

#### ‚ë¢ Access the API Interface

Open your browser and visit http://0.0.0.0:8080/docs Or http://0.0.0.0:8080/redoc

### Manual Deployment üì¶

#### ‚ë† Create a Python Virtual Environment

It is recommended to create a Python virtual environment
using [conda](https://conda.io/projects/conda/en/latest/user-guide/install/index.html)

```shell
git clone https://github.com/harry0703/MoneyPrinterTurbo.git
cd MoneyPrinterTurbo
conda create -n MoneyPrinterTurbo python=3.10
conda activate MoneyPrinterTurbo
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

#### ‚ë° Install ImageMagick

###### Windows:

- Download https://imagemagick.org/archive/binaries/ImageMagick-7.1.1-29-Q16-x64-static.exe
- Install the downloaded ImageMagick, **do not change the installation path**
- Modify the `config.toml` configuration file, set `imagemagick_path` to your actual installation path (if you didn't
  change the path during installation, just uncomment it)

###### MacOS:

```shell
brew install imagemagick
````

###### Ubuntu

```shell
sudo apt-get install imagemagick
```

###### CentOS

```shell
sudo yum install ImageMagick
```

#### ‚ë¢ Launch the Web Interface üåê

Note that you need to execute the following commands in the `root directory` of the MoneyPrinterTurbo project

###### Windows

```bat
conda activate MoneyPrinterTurbo
webui.bat
```

###### MacOS or Linux

```shell
conda activate MoneyPrinterTurbo
sh webui.sh
```

After launching, the browser will open automatically

#### ‚ë£ Launch the API Service üöÄ

```shell
python main.py
```

After launching, you can view the `API documentation` at http://127.0.0.1:8080/docs and directly test the interface
online for a quick experience.

## Voice Synthesis üó£

A list of all supported voices can be viewed here: [Voice List](./docs/voice-list.txt)

## Subtitle Generation üìú

Currently, there are 2 ways to generate subtitles:

- edge: Faster generation speed, better performance, no specific requirements for computer configuration, but the
  quality may be unstable
- whisper: Slower generation speed, poorer performance, specific requirements for computer configuration, but more
  reliable quality

You can switch between them by modifying the `subtitle_provider` in the `config.toml` configuration file

It is recommended to use `edge` mode, and switch to `whisper` mode if the quality of the subtitles generated is not
satisfactory.

> Note:
> If left blank, it means no subtitles will be generated.

**Download whisper**
- Please ensure a good internet connectivity
- `whisper` model can be downloaded from HuggingFace: https://huggingface.co/openai/whisper-large-v3/tree/main

After downloading the model to local machine, copy the whole folder and put it into the following path: `.\MoneyPrinterTurbo\models`

This is what the final path should look like: `.\MoneyPrinterTurbo\models\whisper-large-v3`

```
MoneyPrinterTurbo  
  ‚îú‚îÄmodels
  ‚îÇ   ‚îî‚îÄwhisper-large-v3
  ‚îÇ          config.json
  ‚îÇ          model.bin
  ‚îÇ          preprocessor_config.json
  ‚îÇ          tokenizer.json
  ‚îÇ          vocabulary.json
```

## Background Music üéµ

Background music for videos is located in the project's `resource/songs` directory.
> The current project includes some default music from YouTube videos. If there are copyright issues, please delete
> them.

## Subtitle Fonts üÖ∞

Fonts for rendering video subtitles are located in the project's `resource/fonts` directory, and you can also add your
own fonts.

## Common Questions ü§î

### ‚ùìHow to Use the Free OpenAI GPT-3.5 Model?

[OpenAI has announced that ChatGPT with 3.5 is now free](https://openai.com/blog/start-using-chatgpt-instantly), and
developers have wrapped it into an API for direct usage.

**Ensure you have Docker installed and running**. Execute the following command to start the Docker service:

```shell
docker run -p 3040:3040 missuo/freegpt35
```

Once successfully started, modify the `config.toml` configuration as follows:

- Set `llm_provider` to `openai`
- Fill in `openai_api_key` with any value, for example, '123456'
- Change `openai_base_url` to `http://localhost:3040/v1/`
- Set `openai_model_name` to `gpt-3.5-turbo`

### ‚ùìRuntimeError: No ffmpeg exe could be found

Normally, ffmpeg will be automatically downloaded and detected.
However, if your environment has issues preventing automatic downloads, you may encounter the following error:

```
RuntimeError: No ffmpeg exe could be found.
Install ffmpeg on your system, or set the IMAGEIO_FFMPEG_EXE environment variable.
```

In this case, you can download ffmpeg from https://www.gyan.dev/ffmpeg/builds/, unzip it, and set `ffmpeg_path` to your
actual installation path.

```toml
[app]
# Please set according to your actual path, note that Windows path separators are \\
ffmpeg_path = "C:\\Users\\harry\\Downloads\\ffmpeg.exe"
```

### ‚ùìError generating audio or downloading videos

[issue 56](https://github.com/harry0703/MoneyPrinterTurbo/issues/56)

```
failed to generate audio, maybe the network is not available. 
if you are in China, please use a VPN.
```

[issue 44](https://github.com/harry0703/MoneyPrinterTurbo/issues/44)

```
failed to download videos, maybe the network is not available. 
if you are in China, please use a VPN.
```

This is likely due to network issues preventing access to foreign services. Please use a VPN to resolve this.

### ‚ùìImageMagick is not installed on your computer

[issue 33](https://github.com/harry0703/MoneyPrinterTurbo/issues/33)

1. Follow the `example configuration` provided `download address` to
   install https://imagemagick.org/archive/binaries/ImageMagick-7.1.1-30-Q16-x64-static.exe, using the static library
2. Do not install in a path with Chinese characters to avoid unpredictable issues

[issue 54](https://github.com/harry0703/MoneyPrinterTurbo/issues/54#issuecomment-2017842022)

For Linux systems, you can manually install it, refer to https://cn.linux-console.net/?p=16978
