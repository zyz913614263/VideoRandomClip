### ‚ùìHow to Use the Free OpenAI GPT-3.5 Model?

[OpenAI has announced that ChatGPT with 3.5 is now free](https://openai.com/blog/start-using-chatgpt-instantly), and
developers have wrapped it into an API for direct usage.

**Ensure you have Docker installed and running**. Execute the following command to start the Docker service:

```shell
docker run -p 3040:3040 missuo/freegpt35
```

Once successfully started, modify the `config.toml` configuration as follows:

- Set `llm_provider` to `openai`
- Fill in `openai_api_key` with any value, for example, '123456'
- Change `openai_base_url` to `http://localhost:3040/v1/`
- Set `openai_model_name` to `gpt-3.5-turbo`

### ‚ùìRuntimeError: No ffmpeg exe could be found

Normally, ffmpeg will be automatically downloaded and detected.
However, if your environment has issues preventing automatic downloads, you may encounter the following error:

```
RuntimeError: No ffmpeg exe could be found.
Install ffmpeg on your system, or set the IMAGEIO_FFMPEG_EXE environment variable.
```

In this case, you can download ffmpeg from https://www.gyan.dev/ffmpeg/builds/, unzip it, and set `ffmpeg_path` to your
actual installation path.

```toml
[app]
# Please set according to your actual path, note that Windows path separators are \\
ffmpeg_path = "C:\\Users\\harry\\Downloads\\ffmpeg.exe"
```

```

[issue 44](https://github.com/harry0703/MoneyPrinterTurbo/issues/44)

   install https://imagemagick.org/archive/binaries/ImageMagick-7.1.1-30-Q16-x64-static.exe, using the static library
2. Do not install in a path with Chinese characters to avoid unpredictable issues
